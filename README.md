# Veterinary-Clinic-Project

This project is a veterinary clinic which provides services such as home service and clinic service. These two sections are further biforcated into domesticated pets and livestock/wild animals. It provides list of doctors and their availability as per section selected, where each appointment duration is set to 30 minutes. User can select the date and time, location as well as the veterinary doctor available. Other than this the form contains required details such as location, phone number, pet owner details, email id, pet's current disease, any list of allergies/disease the pet has and two attachment option 1) image file 2) doc file. After submitting the details, the user recieves an email which informs, the clinic has recieved their details and will soon contact them shortly. Once the clinic's reception receives the details submitted by the user, the person can either accept or deny the request as per availability of the clinic and the doctor, or reschedule the appointment to another day or time. This is done with the help of Jotform's form submission email notifications functionality. The details submitted by the pet owner is saved in mysql database as well as details of doctors and their qualifications. The website also has send email option where they can send mail to the clinic's mail id. Also, the clinic's physical map location is mapped in the website and on click of map it will direct the user to the google maps locating the clinic's location.
